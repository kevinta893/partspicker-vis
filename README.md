## About
This is a Information Visualization project on the listings of complete builds on PCPartPicker.com. The visualization aims to improve exploration of these complete builds and assist users make informed choices on computer parts.

The visualization consists of two parts: a scatterplot to explore value-performance, and a stacked bar chart to compare budgeting across some related builds.

Some computer builds have been filtered out for the utility of the visualization. A complete build consists of at least:
* CPU
* Video Card
* RAM
* Motherboard
* Power supply
* Case
* Storage (â‰¥1)

Currently, the visualization runs best on Chrome.
